üõçÔ∏è Returns Prediction: Graph-Based vs Tabular E-Commerce Modeling

This project compares two distinct datasets and modeling strategies to understand and predict return behavior in e-commerce platforms:
	1.	Graph-based approach (ASOS Returns Prediction)
	2.	Tabular data modeling (TheLook E-Commerce)

1. üß† Modeling Approaches (Non-Technical Overview)

‚úÖ Why Two Methods?

Return prediction is an important task for e-commerce logistics and customer satisfaction. We explored two modeling strategies:

üì¶ A. Tabular Modeling (TheLook Dataset)
	‚Ä¢	Each row is a single purchase.
	‚Ä¢	Features include: product category, customer age, price, shipping latency, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Model used: Logistic Regression (or other classifiers like XGBoost).
	‚Ä¢	Advantage: Simple, interpretable, and integrates easily with business rules.
	‚Ä¢	Limitation: Treats each transaction in isolation.

üß© B. Graph Modeling (ASOS Dataset)
	‚Ä¢	Graph structure:
	‚Ä¢	Nodes: Customers & Products
	‚Ä¢	Edges: Purchases (labeled with return = 0/1)
	‚Ä¢	Model used: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
	‚Ä¢	Advantage: Learns shared return patterns (e.g., product clusters, return-prone users)
	‚Ä¢	Limitation: No time information, and only includes customers who returned at least once.

2. üìÅ Dataset Documentation

A. ASOS GraphReturns Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Source: OSF (Open Science Framework)
	‚Ä¢	Structure:
	‚Ä¢	Edge list of interactions with return labels
	‚Ä¢	Anonymized node features (no semantics)
	‚Ä¢	Known Flaws:
	‚Ä¢	No timestamps (can‚Äôt analyze order sequence or time-based behavior)
	‚Ä¢	Biased: Only includes customers with at least one return
	‚Ä¢	How to Recreate:
	‚Ä¢	Download the dataset from OSF: [ASOS GraphReturns Dataset on OSF](https://osf.io/c793h/)

B. TheLook E-Commerce Dataset
	‚Ä¢	Source: Kaggle (originally from Google BigQuery)
	‚Ä¢	Structure: Split into 4 CSVs:
	1.	order_items.csv (transactions)
	2.	products.csv (SKU data)
	3.	users.csv (demographics)
	4.	distribution_centers.csv (fulfillment hubs)
	‚Ä¢	Known Flaws:
	‚Ä¢	Missing or null timestamps for some shipping or return fields
	‚Ä¢	Not all features are consistent across time periods
	‚Ä¢	Synthetic PII (emails, addresses) used for demo purposes
	‚Ä¢	How to Recreate:
	‚Ä¢	Download the dataset from Kaggle: [TheLook Ecommerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aniqohhanahaura/thelook-dataset)

üìå Conclusion

Model Type	Suitable For	Not Ideal For
Tabular	Interpretability, fast deployment, numeric & categorical features	Capturing relationship patterns
Graph	Complex patterns, user-product co-behaviors	Requires dense data, harder to explain

Both approaches offer insight into product return behavior from different angles. Use them individually or hybridize for ensemble learning!
