## Exploration Phase

The initial exploration of the `ASOS_GraphReturns` dataset has been completed. This involved:

- **Loading Data:** Identifying and loading the `customer_nodes`, `event_table`, and `product_nodes` datasets (both training and testing sets) from their respective CSV files.
- **Initial Inspection:** Examining the shape, column names, data types, and checking for missing values in each dataset.
- **Key Observations:** Documenting the content and structure of each dataset, noting the use of hashed IDs for linking and pre-encoded categorical features.
- **Data Quality Assessment:** A preliminary assessment of data consistency and completeness.

For a detailed report of the exploration findings, including observations and next steps, please refer to `report.md` in this directory.
