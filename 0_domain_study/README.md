# 📚 Domain Research – Product Return Prediction in E-Commerce

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**Which customer and product-level features are
the strongest predictors of product returns
in e-commerce, and how can optimizing product descriptions
and user experience (UX) reduce these returns?**

---

## 🔍 Research Overview

This project investigates the **systemic causes**
behind high return rates in e-commerce, using **systems thinking** and
the **Iceberg Model**. We explore not only the v
isible return events but also the deeper **patterns**, **structures**,
and **mental models** that contribute to them.

## ⛴️ Iceberg Model – Systems Thinking Approach

### 📌 Event (What We See)

High return rates (15–30%) are common in e-commerce,
especially in fashion (up to 40%).
Returns create major operational and financial challenges.
**Common reasons include:**

* Size or fit issues
* Products not matching descriptions
* Poor product quality or damaged items
* Impulse buying and buyer’s remorse

---

### 📈 Pattern / Trend

* **Fashion and apparel** show highest return rates (20–40%)
* **Electronics and home goods** show 10–20% returns
* **First-time customers** return more than repeat ones
* **Mobile users** return more, often due to poor UX
* **Misleading or incomplete descriptions** increase return probability

---

### 🏗️ Structure

* Lack of **comprehensive product details** (e.g., size, materials)
* Poor **search and filtering** systems
* No **standardized sizing guides**
* Limited **user-generated content** (reviews, photos, Q\&A)
* Weak **mobile UX** makes evaluation difficult
* Absence of **virtual try-on** or AR tools in product view

---

### 💭 Mental Models

* Assumption: "More choices = better experience"
* Overconfidence in fast checkouts over thorough evaluation
* Belief that **return policies replace product accuracy**
* Bias toward blaming customer behavior
* Underestimating **cognitive load** in online buying decisions

## 💡 Summary

Returns in e-commerce are not just individual events—they reflect deeper patterns
& structural design issues. This project aims to apply
**AI (supervised learning)** to detect return risks early and suggest
design/UX improvements to reduce return rates over time.
