## 🔎 Quick Summary (for recruiters & readers)  
In this project, we investigated the hidden costs of product returns in online fashion retail. Using real-world e-commerce datasets (ASOS and TheLook), we identified the strongest predictors of returns, debunked common myths, and designed strategies to reduce them. Our work combines **data analysis, machine learning, and science communication** — including an interactive website — to show how data can solve a real business problem.

## Introduction  
We are **Group 17 – Return Avengers: Mission Impostible**, a team of students at MIT Emerging Talent.  
Our mission: *to uncover why fashion e-commerce suffers from high return rates, and how data-driven insights can help retailers fight back.*  

Fashion returns are like bad dates: expensive, awkward, and nobody wins. With this project, we combined storytelling, data science, and a touch of spy humor to explore how returns can be predicted and prevented.

## Problem Statement  
**Research Question:**  
*Which customer and product features best predict product returns in e-commerce, and how can retailers use this to reduce returns?*  

Why it matters:  
- Returns = 👻 Profit eaters, 📦 Inventory hostages, 😤 Customer satisfaction killers.  
- Fashion e-commerce return rates can reach 30–40%, creating huge financial and operational challenges.  

---

## Methodology  
We followed a detective-style process to uncover the “villains” behind returns:  

- **Datasets**: ASOS and TheLook datasets (educational use).  
- **Analysis**: Explored features such as customer behavior, product attributes, and country differences.  
- **Techniques**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and return prediction modeling.  
- **Framing**: Communicated insights using storytelling and an interactive artifact.  

---

## Results  
Our investigation revealed three main “villains”:  

1. **Your past predicts your future** 🔄 — Customers who returned before are highly likely to return again.  
2. **Some clothes are return magnets** 👖 — Jeans and certain brands drive disproportionate return rates.  
3. **Location, location, frustration** 🌍 — Returns vary significantly by country due to sizing and cultural differences.  

🚫 **What doesn’t matter (myth-busting):**  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Premier membership

## Conclusion  
Returns aren’t fate — they’re feedback.  
By focusing on **customer history, product-level risk, and better communication**, retailers can reduce returns and improve both profit margins and customer satisfaction.  

Key recommendations for retailers:  
- Improve product pages (better fit notes, model photos).  
- Localize size charts.  
- Add smart nudges at checkout.  
- Work with high-return brands to improve sizing consistency.  

---

## Future Work  
Potential next steps:  
- Expand research with data from additional retailers beyond ASOS.  
- Explore the role of sustainability in reducing returns.  
- Refine predictive models with deeper product attributes (fabric, cut, fit).  
- Test communication strategies directly with customers.
