## Notes

- The meeting opened with a warm welcome, acknowledging the absence of one team member but maintaining momentum to advance Milestone 1.

- Progress on Milestone 1 was reviewed, noting that additional work is required to finalize deliverables. Tasks were divided to streamline completion: communication, constraints, and learning goals were assigned, with all parts to be integrated into shared files.

- The contributor guidelines were identified as needing completion, alongside the creation of a labeled Git tag to mark the milestone.

- **Deadlines established:**
  - Initial work on communication, constraints, and learning goals to be completed by **June 10, 2025, 11 AM EST**.
  - Entire Milestone 1 due by **June 12, 2025, 11 AM EST**.

- The three domains (Fintech, Healthcare, E-commerce) were discussed. The team unanimously chose to focus on **E-commerce**, specifically targeting **Returns Prediction and Reduction**. This topic was selected due to its relevance to retail industry challenges and its potential to enhance future job opportunities.

- The meeting concluded with a plan to integrate individual contributions into shared files, finalize the research question, and meet the Milestone 1 deadline. Coordination will continue via **Slack** and the shared **Google Document**.
