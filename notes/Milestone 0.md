## Notes

The meeting began with an icebreaker where everyone shared favorite data tools
or fun facts, sparking laughter and setting a vibrant tone. Tech confessions
energized the discussion.

The project overview outlined an opportunity to tackle a real-world challenge,
with deliverables including an exploratory data analysis (EDA), a predictive
model, and a final presentation. A clear, impactful research question by
Milestone 0â€™s end was emphasized, along with a focus on collaboration,
transparency, and leveraging team strengths.

Deliverables were clarified, with a suggestion for a feasible yet ambitious
project. A shared GitHub repo was proposed for transparency, with the setup
task assigned for completion by June 9, 2025.

Group norms were discussed, focusing on regular communication, mutual respect,
and sticking to deadlines. Google Drive for documents and Slack for quick
updates were suggested, with a commitment to keep meetings engaging yet
focused. An inclusive space for all ideas, even unconventional ones, was
prioritized.

Conflict resolution strategies favored open discussions in meetings or using a
mediator if needed, with a team member assigned to ensure smooth collaboration.

Group norms were summarized as:

- Communicate via Slack and Google Meet.
- Stick to deadlines and flag delays early.
- Foster an open environment for all ideas.
- Document everything in the GitHub repo.
- Keep the energy engaging but productive.

Work distribution focused on playing to strengths while collaborating on major
deliverables like EDA and modeling. Rotating roles (e.g., note-taker,
facilitator) was suggested for variety. Tasks were assigned: researching
visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn), exploring modeling
frameworks (e.g., Scikit-learn), sourcing data, and digging into potential
research questions.

Research question brainstorming narrowed the focus to three domains: Fintech,
Healthcare, and E-commerce. Examples like predicting loan defaults, patient
outcome analysis, or customer purchase behavior were discussed, with consensus
on their potential for rich datasets and significant impact.

A plan was set for each member to research one of the three domains to
identify datasets and research questions for the next meeting. Domains were
split up: Fintech, Healthcare, and E-commerce for respective pairs. A shared
Google Document was designated for collecting problem ideas.

A meeting schedule was established for Mondays and Fridays at 9:00 AM EST via
Google Meet, with a Google Calendar invite suggested to keep everyone
organized.

The meeting concluded with enthusiasm for a productive kickoff, urging
everyone to dive into their domains, share findings in Slack, and add problem
ideas to the shared Google Document before the next meeting on Monday,
June 9, 2025.
