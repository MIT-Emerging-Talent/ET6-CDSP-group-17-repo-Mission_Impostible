# ASOS Return Prediction: Results Communication

## üåç Project Overview

This document communicates the main findings from the ASOS Return Prediction project. It focuses on **insights, patterns, and visualizations** to help understand why products are returned and how this knowledge can be applied.

## üèÜ Key Findings

### Model Performance

Three models were evaluated for predicting returns:

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | ROC AUC |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| XGBoost             | 0.742    | 0.751     | 0.798  | 0.825   |
| Logistic Regression | 0.739    | 0.749     | 0.793  | 0.820   |
| Random Forest       | 0.725    | 0.742     | 0.771  | 0.801   |

* **XGBoost** performed best in distinguishing returned vs. non-returned items.

### Feature Importance

The most influential predictors of returns were:

* **Customer past return rate**
* **Product return rate**
* **Shipping country**
* **Customer demographics** (smaller effect)

### Patterns in Returns

#### Dimensionality Reduction

* **PCA**: Showed partial separation between returned and non-returned items
  !\[PCA Plot]\(4\_data\_analysis/ASOS dataset/Models/pca\_plot.png)

* **t-SNE**: Showed more distinct clusters but still overlapping

#### SHAP Analysis

* Explains individual predictions and global feature impact

## üìà Insights Summary

* **Customer behavior** is the strongest driver of returns.
* Certain products, brands, and regions are consistently more prone to returns.
* Returns are influenced by **complex, high-dimensional patterns**, as confirmed by PCA, t-SNE, SHAP, and exploratory visualizations.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Limitations

* Predictions are **probabilistic**, not deterministic.
* External factors (e.g., trends, seasonality) are not included.
* Missing features such as product descriptions or fit issues limit interpretability.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

* Returns are **predictable to a useful extent** using historical customer and product behavior.
* Insights can help ASOS:

  * Improve inventory and logistics planning
  * Target high-return product categories for improvement
  * Personalize customer guidance to reduce avoidable returns
