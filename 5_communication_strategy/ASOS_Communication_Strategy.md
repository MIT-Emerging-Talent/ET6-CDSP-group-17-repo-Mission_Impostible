# ASOS Return Prediction: Results Communication & Stakeholder Analysis

## üåç Project Overview

This document communicates the main findings from the ASOS Return Prediction project, integrating both **modeling results**, **data exploration insights**, and a **stakeholder analysis**. It focuses on patterns, feature importance, and visualizations to help understand why products are returned and how different stakeholders can use these insights.

## üèÜ Key Findings

### Model Performance

Three models were evaluated for predicting returns:

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | ROC AUC |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| XGBoost             | 0.742    | 0.751     | 0.798  | 0.825   |
| Logistic Regression | 0.739    | 0.749     | 0.793  | 0.820   |
| Random Forest       | 0.725    | 0.742     | 0.771  | 0.801   |

* **XGBoost** performed best in distinguishing returned vs. non-returned items.

### Patterns in Returns

#### Dimensionality Reduction

* **PCA**: Showed partial separation between returned and non-returned items

  ![PCA Plot](Visualizations/pca_plot.png)
  
* **t-SNE**: Showed more distinct clusters, but still overlapping

#### SHAP Analysis

* Explains individual predictions and global feature impact

## üë• Stakeholder Analysis

### Target Audience

A mid-sized online fashion retailer specializing in formal and event wear.

**Key stakeholders:**

* **Founder/CEO** ‚Äì concerned with profitability, reputation, growth.
* **Head of Merchandising/Buying** ‚Äì impacts inventory and product selection.
* **Marketing Manager** ‚Äì manages promotions, customer communication, social media.
* **E-commerce Manager** ‚Äì responsible for website experience and product content.
* **Operations/Customer Service Lead** ‚Äì manages shipping, returns, and customer feedback.

### Capabilities

* Agility in decision-making (faster than large corporations).
* Deep niche expertise in formal/event wear.
* Direct customer feedback loop through service leads.

### Constraints

* Limited resources and smaller data teams.
* Supplier influence limited.
* High customer expectations for fit and quality.

### Communication Strategy

* **Primary**: Hands-on strategy workshop with stakeholders.
* **Secondary**: Practical ‚ÄúPlaybook Report‚Äù (e.g., *5-Step Playbook to Reduce Returns by 15%*).
* **Tertiary**: Lightweight integrated tool to predict product return risk.

### What Stakeholders Should Learn

* Pinpoint the biggest drivers of returns (e.g., product types, fabrics).
* Quantify the financial drain of returns.
* Spot high-risk products earlier in the buying process.
* Appreciate the value of better product data and descriptions.

### Recommended Actions

* **Buying Team**: Review high-risk product categories; negotiate smaller initial orders.
* **Marketing**: Create content for better customer fit guidance; pause ads on high-return items.
* **E-commerce Manager**: Update product pages with better visuals and fit notes.
* **CEO**: Champion data-driven strategy with a dedicated returns-reduction budget.

## üìà Insights Summary

* **Customer behavior** is the strongest driver of returns.
* Certain products, brands, and regions are consistently more prone to returns.
* Returns are influenced by **complex, high-dimensional patterns**, as confirmed by PCA, t-SNE, SHAP, and exploratory visualizations.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Limitations

* Predictions are **probabilistic**, not deterministic.
* External factors (e.g., trends, seasonality) are not included.
* Missing features such as product descriptions, material, and fit issues limit interpretability.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

* Returns are **predictable to a useful extent** using historical customer and product behavior.
* Insights can help ASOS:

  * Improve inventory and logistics planning
  * Target high-return product categories for improvement
  * Personalize customer guidance to reduce avoidable returns
* Stakeholders can use these findings to implement **practical, high-impact changes** across buying, marketing, e-commerce, and customer service.
