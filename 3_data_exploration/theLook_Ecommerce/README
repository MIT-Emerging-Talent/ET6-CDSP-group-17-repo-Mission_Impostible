# ðŸ“¦ TheLook E-commerce â€” Data Exploration

This notebook documents our first look at the cleaned feature set and highlights the main patterns weâ€™ll investigate further in the analysis phase.

---

## 1. Data Loaded
- **File:** `thelook_returns_features.csv`  
- Shape: *rows Ã— columns* printed in the notebook header.

---

## 2. Quick Inspection
- Checked column data types and missing-value counts.
- No major null issues; dataset is ready for analysis.

- **Returned:** 10 %  
- **Kept:** 90 %

## 4. Return Rates by Key Categories

ðŸ“¸ *Insert return rate bar charts here (one for each variable below)*

| Category                     | Return Rate                | Notes                         |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Gender**                   | Male 10.1%, Female 10.0%   | Very similar behaviour        |
| **Season**                   | Fall highest               | Mild seasonal variation       |
| **Product Category**         | Clothing Sets highest      | Common sizing/fit issue       |
| **Country**                  | Germany 10.5%, Australia 9.6% | Regional difference         |

## 5. Numeric Distributions

ðŸ“¸ *Insert histograms for the following:*

- `age`
- `discount_pct`
- `basket_size`
- `ship_latency_days`
- `tenure_days`

> The distributions are reasonable; no major outliers or skewed values observed.

## 6. Correlation Heat-map

ðŸ“¸ *Insert heatmap screenshot here*

- Most numeric features show **weak linear correlation** with `RETURN_FLAG`.
- Confirms weâ€™ll need **non-linear models** or **categorical features** to explain returns effectively.

## 7. First Observations

- **Gender** has no meaningful impact on returns.
- **Season** and **product category** affect return ratesâ€”clothing and fall show higher returns.
- **Regional trends** suggest operational or cultural return behaviour.
- **Numeric features alone arenâ€™t predictive**, but will support a model alongside categorical data.

These insights will inform our upcoming **Data Analysis** phase, where we build models and quantify the impact of each feature.
