# ASOS_GraphReturns Data Exploration

This directory contains files related to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase for the `ASOS_GraphReturns` dataset.

## Data Exploration Phase

This phase involved a detailed examination of the prepared dataset (`prepared_asos_data.csv`) to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights relevant to product returns. Key aspects of the exploration included:

- **Initial Data Overview:** Confirming the structure and quality of the prepared data.
- **Target Variable Distribution:** Analyzing the balance of returned vs. non-returned items.
- **Categorical Feature Analysis:** Investigating return rates across different genders, shipping countries, and product types.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying features most strongly correlated with product returns.

Visualizations were used extensively to illustrate these findings. For a detailed report of the data exploration findings, including conceptual descriptions of the visualizations, please refer to `report.md` in this directory.
