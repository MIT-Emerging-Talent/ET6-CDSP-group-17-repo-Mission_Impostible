# ASOS_GraphReturns Data Exploration Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the `prepared_asos_data.csv` dataset. The objective of this phase is to gain deeper insights into the data, understand the relationships between variables, and identify patterns that may influence product returns. Visualizations are used to illustrate key findings.

## Data Loading and Initial Check
- The `prepared_asos_data.csv` file, generated from the data preparation phase, was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- An initial check confirmed the shape, columns, data types, and absence of significant missing values, ensuring the data is ready for exploration.

## Key Exploratory Findings

### 1. Distribution of Product Returns (`isReturned`)
- **Observation:** The dataset shows a distribution of returned vs. non-returned items. (A bar plot showing counts of 0 and 1 for `isReturned` would be included here).
- **Insight:** This provides a baseline understanding of the class balance for the target variable. For example, if there are significantly more non-returns than returns, this indicates a class imbalance that might need to be addressed during model training.

### 2. Return Rate by Gender (`isMale`)
- **Observation:** A bar plot comparing the average return rate for male (1) and female (0) customers. (A bar plot showing average `isReturned` for `isMale` categories would be included here).
- **Insight:** This visualization helps determine if there's a noticeable difference in return behavior between genders. For instance, one gender might have a higher propensity to return products.

### 3. Return Rate by Shipping Country
- **Observation:** Bar plots showing the average return rate for the top 10 shipping countries. (Bar plots showing average `isReturned` for `shippingCountry` categories or `Country_X` one-hot encoded columns would be included here).
- **Insight:** Different countries might exhibit varying return patterns due to cultural differences, shipping policies, or product fit. Identifying countries with unusually high or low return rates can be valuable.

### 4. Return Rate by Product Type
- **Observation:** Bar plots illustrating the average return rate for the top 10 product types. (Bar plots showing average `isReturned` for `productType` categories or `productType_X` one-hot encoded columns would be included here).
- **Insight:** Certain product categories might inherently have higher return rates (e.g., clothing due to sizing issues) than others. This analysis helps pinpoint problematic product types.

### 5. Correlation Analysis
- **Observation:** A bar plot displaying the top 15 features most correlated (positively and negatively) with the `isReturned` variable. (A horizontal bar plot of feature importance scores would be included here).
- **Insight:** This provides a quantitative measure of how strongly each feature is associated with product returns. Features with high positive correlation increase the likelihood of a return, while those with high negative correlation decrease it. This is crucial for feature selection in the modeling phase.

## Visualizations (Conceptual Descriptions)

- **Count Plot for `isReturned`:** A bar chart showing the number of instances for `isReturned = 0` (not returned) and `isReturned = 1` (returned).
- **Bar Plot for Return Rate by Gender:** A bar chart with 'Gender' on the x-axis and 'Average Return Rate' on the y-axis.
- **Bar Plot for Return Rate by Shipping Country:** A bar chart with 'Shipping Country' on the x-axis and 'Average Return Rate' on the y-axis, showing the top 10 countries.
- **Bar Plot for Return Rate by Product Type:** A bar chart with 'Product Type' on the x-axis and 'Average Return Rate' on the y-axis, showing the top 10 product types.
- **Horizontal Bar Plot for Feature Correlations:** A horizontal bar chart showing the correlation coefficients of the top 15 features with `isReturned`.

## Next Steps
Based on these exploratory findings, the next phase will focus on:
1. **Data Analysis/Modeling:** Building predictive models to forecast product returns, leveraging the insights gained from EDA.
2. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models.
3. **Reporting:** Documenting all steps and findings in detailed reports and updating `README.md` files.
