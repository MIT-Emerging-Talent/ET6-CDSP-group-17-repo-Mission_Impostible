# 📝 Milestone 3 Retrospective

## ✅ Milestone Status
Milestone 3 was completed successfully and on time, which is a positive reflection of our team’s ability to meet deadlines under pressure. Despite some coordination challenges, we managed to deliver the expected outcomes and maintain the overall project timeline.

## 🗣️ Communication & Task Ownership
We made efforts to communicate tasks among the team, using our designated channels to break down responsibilities. However, task ownership remains a persistent issue. In several cases, responsibilities were unclear or not followed through, making it hard to progress smoothly. This led to delays in decision-making and uncertainty about who should be working on what.

## 🚀 Initiative
Fortunately, a few of the most engaged team members consistently stepped up to carry the workload and keep momentum going. Their proactive approach played a key role in the successful completion of this milestone. Without their initiative, some critical tasks may have been left incomplete.

## 🤝 Improvement Opportunity
Looking ahead, it’s important that more members actively participate and take initiative, rather than waiting to be assigned tasks. A fair distribution of work would not only reduce pressure on the most active contributors but also foster a stronger team dynamic. Cultivating shared responsibility and accountability can help us grow as a more cohesive and efficient group.
