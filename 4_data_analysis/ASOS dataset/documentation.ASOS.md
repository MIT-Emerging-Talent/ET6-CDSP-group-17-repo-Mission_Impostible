## 📊 Key Findings

### 1. Return Behavior by Age
Younger customers (ages 16–25) are more likely to return products compared to older age groups. This may reflect more impulsive buying behavior or size uncertainty.

### 2. Gender and Return Rate
Although the dataset is balanced by gender, female customers show slightly higher return rates than males. This might reflect differences in shopping behavior or product expectations.
