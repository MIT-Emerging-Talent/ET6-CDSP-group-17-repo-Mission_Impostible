## Technical Analysis of Product Return Rates

This analysis aimed to identify key factors influencing product return rates using a provided dataset. The methodology involved exploring return rates across various categorical and numerical features and visualizing these relationships, as well as training a logistic regression model to understand feature importance.

**Data Loading and Initial Inspection:**

The dataset `asos_merged_training.csv` was loaded into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`. Initial inspection was performed using `df.info()` to check data types and non-null counts, `df.shape` to get the number of rows and columns, and `df.head()` to view the first few rows and understand the data structure.

**Return Rate Calculations and Visualizations:**

Return rates were calculated as the mean of the `isReturned` column (where 1 indicates a return and 0 indicates no return) for different groups. The `groupby()` function in pandas was used for these aggregations. Visualizations were generated using `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`.

1.  **Return Frequency per Customer:** A histogram of the total number of returns per customer (`df.groupby("customer_id")["isReturned"].sum()`) was plotted using `sns.histplot` to understand the distribution of return activity among customers.
2.  **Customer Return Rate Distribution:** A histogram of the average return rate per customer (`df.groupby("customer_id")["isReturned"].mean()`) was plotted using `sns.histplot` to visualize the distribution of individual customer return behaviors.
3.  **Return Rate by Shipping Country:** The mean return rate was calculated for each `shippingCountry` (`df.groupby('shippingCountry')['isReturned'].mean()`). A horizontal bar plot of the top 10 countries by return rate was generated using `plot(kind='barh')` to highlight geographical variations.
4.  **Return Rate by Product Type:** The mean return rate was calculated for each `productType` (`df.groupby('productType')['isReturned'].mean()`). A horizontal bar plot of the top 10 product types by return rate was generated using `plot(kind='barh')` to identify product categories with high return rates.
5.  **Return Rate by Brand:** The mean return rate was calculated for each `brandDesc` (`df.groupby('brandDesc')['isReturned'].mean()`). A horizontal bar plot of the top 10 brands by return rate was generated using `plot(kind='barh')` to show brand-specific return tendencies.
6.  **Return Rate by Age Group:** 'yearOfBirth' was converted to numeric, and 'age' was calculated. A reasonable age range (15-90) was applied, and customers were grouped into predefined age bins using `pd.cut`. The mean return rate was calculated for each `age_group` (`df.groupby("age_group")["isReturned"].mean()`). A bar plot was generated using `sns.barplot` to visualize how return rates vary across different age demographics.
7.  **Return Rate by Gender:** The mean return rate was calculated for `isMale` (`df.groupby("isMale")["isReturned"].mean()`). A bar plot was generated using `sns.barplot` to compare return rates between genders.
8.  **Return Rate by Premier Status:** The mean return rate was calculated for `premier` status (`df.groupby("premier")["isReturned"].mean()`). A bar plot was generated using `sns.barplot` to assess the impact of premier status on return rates.

**Model Training and Interpretation (Logistic Regression):**

A Logistic Regression model was trained to predict `isReturned` using a subset of features: `avgGbpPrice`, `avgDiscountValue`, `salesPerCustomer`, `returnsPerCustomer`, and encoded `brandDesc`. `brandDesc` was encoded using `.astype('category').cat.codes`. The data was split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`. The model was trained using `LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)`.

*   **Feature Importance:** The coefficients of the trained Logistic Regression model (`model.coef_[0]`) were extracted and plotted as a horizontal bar chart. The magnitude and sign of the coefficients indicate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between each feature and the log-odds of returning a product. For example, a positive coefficient for `returnsPerCustomer` suggests that as the number of past returns increases, the likelihood of a product being returned also increases.

**Key Findings:**

The analysis and model revealed several factors associated with higher return rates:

*   Specific **Shipping Countries**, **Product Types**, and **Brands** exhibited higher return rates, as shown in the respective bar plots.
*   Older **Age Groups** and **Female** customers showed slightly higher average return rates.
*   **Premier Status** did not appear to be a significant determinant of return rate.
*   Customers with a higher number of previous **ReturnsPerCustomer** were significantly more likely to return items, as indicated by the positive Logistic Regression coefficient and the distribution plots.
*   A higher number of **SalesPerCustomer** was associated with a lower return rate (negative coefficient).
*   `avgGbpPrice` had a small positive impact, while `avgDiscountValue` had a small negative impact on return likelihood, based on the Logistic Regression coefficients.

**Limitations and Alternative Approaches:**

*   **Observational Nature:** This analysis is observational and identifies associations, not causation. Confounding factors not included in the dataset could influence the observed relationships.
*   **Limited Feature Set for Modeling:** The Logistic Regression model was trained on a limited subset of features. Including more features, especially the one-hot encoded categorical variables, could improve model performance and provide a more comprehensive understanding of feature importance.
*   **Linearity Assumption (Logistic Regression):** Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the outcome. This may not fully capture complex, non-linear relationships present in the data.
*   **Visualization Limitations:** Bar plots and histograms provide aggregated views and may not reveal interactions between different features.
*   **Potential for Confounding:** The analysis of individual features (e.g., age group, gender) in isolation might be influenced by other unexamined factors.

**Alternative Analytical Approaches:**

*   **More Complex Models:** Tree-based models like Random Forest (already explored in previous steps) or Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) can capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions more effectively.
*   **Interaction Analysis:** Explicitly analyzing interactions between features could provide deeper insights (e.g., how the impact of discount varies by product type).
*   **Causal Inference Techniques:** To understand causal relationships (e.g., does being a premier customer *cause* a lower return rate?), techniques like propensity score matching or causal graphical models could be employed.
*   **More Granular Data:** Access to more detailed data, such as the specific reason for return, product fit information, or customer feedback, would enable a more nuanced analysis.

**Conclusion:**

The analysis successfully identified key demographic, behavioral, and product-related factors associated with product return rates. The findings from the visualizations and the Logistic Regression model provide actionable insights into which customer segments, product categories, and brands are most impacted by returns. While the current analysis provides a strong foundation, future work could explore more complex models and incorporate additional data for a more comprehensive understanding and improved predictive capability. The provided scripts facilitate the replication of this analysis.
