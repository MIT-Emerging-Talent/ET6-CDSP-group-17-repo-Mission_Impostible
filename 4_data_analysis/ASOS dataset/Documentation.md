## Understanding Why Products Get Returned: A Simple Explanation

Our goal was to figure out why some products bought by customers are returned more often than others. This helps us understand our customers better and find ways to reduce returns, which saves us money and makes customers happier.

We looked at information about past purchases, including details about the customers, the products they bought, and where they live. We then analyzed this information to see if certain things are linked to products being returned.

Hereâ€™s what we found by looking at different factors:

**Where Customers Live (Shipping Country):** We saw that customers in some countries return items more often than in others. This could be due to things like different sizing standards, shipping issues, or local preferences. For example, Country_E and Country_B appear to have higher return rates compared to other countries like Country_D and Country_A.

**Types of Products (Product Type):** Some types of products are returned more frequently than others. This might suggest that there are issues with the fit, quality, or description of certain product categories. 'productType_B' and 'Jeans' seem to have notably higher return rates than other product types such as 'productType_H' and 'productType_J'.

**Brands:** We also found that return rates vary between different brands. This could be because some brands have more consistent sizing, better quality, or clearer product descriptions. 'Brand_C', 'Brand_I', and 'Brand_J' show higher return rates than 'Brand_G' and 'Brand_K'.

**Customer's Age Group:** Our analysis showed slight differences in return rates across different age groups. Older age groups, particularly '66+', appear to have slightly higher return rates compared to younger age groups like '15-25'.

**Customer's Gender:** We observed a small difference in return rates between genders, with female customers (represented by 0) having a slightly higher average return rate than male customers (represented by 1).

**Premier Customer Status:** Interestingly, being a premier customer (represented by 1) or not (represented by 0) didn't show a significant difference in return rates. Both groups have very similar average return rates.

**Customer's Past Behavior:** How a customer has behaved in the past is a strong indicator. Customers who have returned more items previously are more likely to return items in the future. Similarly, customers who buy more items overall ('salesPerCustomer') tend to have a lower return rate, while those who return more items ('returnsPerCustomer') have a higher return rate. The price of the product ('avgGbpPrice') and the discount applied ('avgDiscountValue') also have a slight influence on return likelihood.

**How Sure Are We? (Certainty Levels):**

Our findings are based on looking at past data and identifying patterns. While these patterns are helpful for understanding what might influence returns, they don't guarantee future outcomes. Customer behavior can change, and there might be reasons for returns that aren't captured in our data. So, we can be reasonably confident about the trends we see, but it's not a perfect prediction.

**Things to Keep in Mind (Potential Errors and Limitations):**

*   **Not all information is included:** Our analysis is based on the data we had. There might be other important things that influence returns, like how a product fits, the reason for the return, or what was happening in the world when the purchase was made (like economic factors), that we didn't include.
*   **The data might not be perfect:** Sometimes, data can have mistakes or be incomplete, which can affect our findings.
*   **External factors:** Things outside of our data, like a heatwave causing people to return winter clothes, can also affect returns and aren't accounted for here.
*   **How we showed the data:** The charts we used are good for seeing general trends, but they simplify things.

**Using These Findings:**

This information is really valuable! Knowing which countries, product types, brands, and customer groups have higher return rates helps us focus our efforts. For example, we can use this to:

*   Improve product descriptions and sizing information for product types or brands with high returns.
*   Tailor our communication to different customer groups based on their age or past behavior to help them make better purchasing decisions and reduce the need to return items.
*   Investigate potential issues in countries with high return rates.

By using these insights, we can develop a communication strategy that helps customers make more informed choices, ultimately leading to fewer returns and a better shopping experience for everyone.
