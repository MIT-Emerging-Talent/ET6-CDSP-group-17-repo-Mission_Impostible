# Technical Documentation for Product Returns Analysis

## Understanding Product Returns
This document provides a simple explanation of our analysis on why some products get returned and others don't. We used a computer model to look at different factors that might influence whether a product is returned.

### How We Did It:
1. **Data Collection**: We used information about customer purchases, like their age, gender, premium customer status, and past buying and returning behavior.
2. **Training a Computer Model**: We fed this data into a Random Forest Classifier, which learns from the data to identify patterns that lead to returns.
3. **Model Evaluation**: We tested the model on unseen data to check its ability to predict returns accurately.

### Key Findings:
- **Customer's Past Return Behavior**: Strongly influences the likelihood of returns.
- **Customer's Age**: Plays a role in return behavior.
- **Sales Per Customer**: Affects return likelihood.

### Certainty Levels and Potential Errors:
- **Accuracy**: The model was about 75% accurate in predicting returns.
- **Potential Errors**:
  - **Data Limitations**: Other influential factors might not be included in the dataset.
  - **Model Limitations**: The Random Forest model may not capture all complex relationships.
  - **Changing Customer Behavior**: Customer preferences can vary over time.

## Data Overview
The analysis is based on the `asos_merged_training.csv` dataset, which contains:
- `variant_id`: Unique identifier for the product variant.
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for the customer.
- `isReturned`: Target variable (1 if returned, 0 otherwise).
- `yearOfBirth`, `isMale`, `shippingCountry`: Demographic information.
- `premier`: Indicates if the customer is a premium customer.
- Other features related to product categories and brands (one-hot encoded).

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Categorical features were one-hot encoded, and unnecessary columns were dropped.
3. **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Classifier was trained on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated using classification reports that provide precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Analysis and Visualizations
- Visualizations were generated to examine return rates by various factors, including:
  - Shipping Country
  - Product Type
  - Brand
  - Age Group
  - Gender
  - Premier Status

## Limitations and Considerations
- The analysis is observational and identifies associations, not causation.
- Visual representations may simplify complex interactions and trends.
- External factors influencing returns might not be captured.

## Conclusion
The analysis effectively identifies key demographic, behavioral, and product-related factors associated with product return rates. The insights can help businesses develop targeted strategies to mitigate returns and enhance customer satisfaction. The provided scripts facilitate the replication of this analysis for further exploration and validation.
