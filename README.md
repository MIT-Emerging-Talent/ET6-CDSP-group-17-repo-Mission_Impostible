## ✨ Who We Are

Welcome to **Mission Impostible**, a team of emerging data scientists from around the globe who are boldly navigating the world of analytics — while quietly battling an all-too-familiar foe: **Imposter Syndrome**.

The name? A cheeky nod to how we feel sometimes. But while we may be new to the game, we’re not backing down. We’re collaborating, learning, and growing together — one dataset at a time — and we’re on a mission to tackle real-world problems with data.

## 🛒 Domain: E-commerce

As a diverse team from different regions and backgrounds, we wanted to work on something **globally relevant**, **business-oriented**, and **personally relatable**. That’s why we’ve chosen the **e-commerce** sector — a rapidly growing field that affects nearly every consumer and retailer worldwide.

## 🎯 Problem Background: Returns in E-commerce

Product returns are one of the biggest headaches for online retailers today. From buyer’s remorse to unclear product information, returns are costing companies **billions** every year — not just in lost sales, but also in the **reverse logistics**, **inventory disruption**, **fraud**, and **environmental waste** they create.

Retailers must handle the entire reverse supply chain — inspecting returned items, restocking (if possible), dealing with damaged goods, and absorbing associated costs. This creates major inefficiencies and affects both profitability and customer satisfaction.

We believe that by applying data science, we can help uncover insights into what drives returns and how to mitigate them.

## 🧪 Research Question (Work in Progress)

> **"What customer or product-level features best predict the likelihood of return, and how can better product information and website design help reduce them?"**

As we begin our exploration, we understand that this question will likely evolve based on data availability and insights. Depending on the focus of the data, we may narrow our scope to:
- Specific product categories (e.g. fashion, electronics), or
- User experience factors (e.g. product descriptions, reviews, sizing charts, images).

## 📚 Project Objectives
- Identify key predictors of product returns.
- Build a model or framework to estimate return probability.
- Suggest practical strategies to reduce return rates (e.g. better product data, UX improvements).
- Communicate findings effectively through visualizations and storytelling.
