# Milestone 2 Retrospective

## ‚úÖ What Went Well
- We made solid progress on key deliverables and began engaging more deeply with the dataset and project objectives.  
- Team members who were active contributed valuable insights and showed initiative in moving tasks forward.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Have Gone Better
- **Lack of a clear and timely plan**: We started without a structured roadmap, which led to delays and uncertainty around priorities.  
- **Unclear task ownership**: Tasks were often left open-ended, waiting for someone to take initiative, which slowed momentum.  
- **Uneven workload distribution**: Without assigning tasks based on skills and availability, some teammates were overloaded while others had little to do.  
- **Lack of engagement from some team members**: A few teammates became inactive or unresponsive, showing no visible contributions or communication. This created friction and placed more pressure on the rest of the team.

## üí° Lessons Learned
- A clear and timely plan from the beginning is essential to keep everyone aligned and reduce last-minute stress.  
- Action items should be clearly defined, with deadlines and assigned owners.  
- Task assignment should be proactive, based on each member‚Äôs strengths and availability‚Äînot left to chance.  
- We need to set expectations for participation and address lack of engagement early to avoid bottlenecks and frustration.

## üéØ Action Items for Next Milestone
- Work more actively based on the shared planning board (GitHub Projects) with deadlines and task owners.  
- Hold a short weekly sync to check progress, redistribute tasks, and surface blockers.  
- Define a clear expectation for minimum participation and communication, and agree on how to handle unresponsiveness.  
- Encourage open and respectful communication about workload and availability so we can adapt as a team.
